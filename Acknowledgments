escheme would not be possible without the prior work of scheme
engineering and educational efforts which I would like to recognize.

1. XLISP and XSCHEME (David Betz)

Betz's contributions, XLISP and XSCHEME, were widely known in the industry
during the 80s and 90s. I used an early version of his XLISP interpreter 
in an AI course. That marked the beginning of my interest in LISP and 
LISP dialects. I have used his XSCHEME compiler-based system to construct
frameworks for software simulation and test.

His XSCHEME system has a coherent and understandable structure. I have borrowed
not only from its organization but also have taken inspiration from many of 
its solutions for primitive functions. However, the implemention of escheme 
diverges in many areas. Principally it is an interperter based system. 
And the implementation of the explicit control evaluator is due 
to my own protracted labors over a period of several years.

2. SICP Explicit Control Evaluator (Harold Abelson and Gerald Sussman)

While browsing The Aerospace Corporation library in the early 90s I discovered 
the MIT textbook "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" 
aka SICP.
 
How I had wished this text had been used for my undergraduate work in computer
science. I devoured the text and relished Chapters 4 and 5 which describe
approaches to implementing interpreters and a compiler for scheme. I have 
used the explicit control evaluator described in Chapter 5 as a starting
point for escheme. It has been expanded to handle many more special forms.

Addendum for extensible-scheme-compiled

Although I started with SICP model compiler in Chapter 5, I have modified it 
to make it almost unrecognizable. The virtual machine I designed for byte code
evaluation is far different from that described in SICP. The resulting compiler
keeps pace.
