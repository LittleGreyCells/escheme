escheme v1.0 would not be possible without the prior work of several scheme
engineering efforts I would like to recognize.

1. XLISP and XSCHEME (David Betz)

Betz's contributions, XLISP and XSCHEME, were widely known in the industry
during the 80s and 90s. I used an early version of his XLISP interpreter 
in an AI course. That marked the beginning of my interest in LISP and 
LISP dialects. I have used his XSCHEME compiler-based system to contruct
frameworks for software simulation and test.

His XSCHEME system is a coherent and understandable implemenation. I have
borrowed heavily not only from its organization but also from many of its 
solutions for primitive functions. However, the implemention of escheme 
diverges in many areas, charting its own course. It is an interperter based
system. And the implementation of the explicit control evaluator is due 
to my own labors over a period of several years.

2. SICP Explicit Control Evaluator (Harold Abelson and Gerald Sussman)

While browsing The Aerospace Corporation library in the early 90s I discovered
their seminal work "The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs"
aka SICP.
 
How I had wished this text had been used for my undergraduate work in computer
science. I devoured the text and relished Chapters 4 and 5 which describe
approaches to implementing an interpreters and compiler for scheme. I have 
usedthe explicit control evaluator described in Chapter 5 as a starting
point for escheme. It has been expanded to handle many more special forms.
