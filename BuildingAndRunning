Building and Running

Building

In the root directory type 'make' to build the executable:

   $make


Running

To run the interpreter, invoke escheme with no arguments. The banner 
is printed and the linenoise prompt is displayed:

   $./escheme
   escheme v1.0

   noise>

To exit escheme, type ^D, ^C or exit function at the prompt:

   noise> (exit)
   $

Initially macros are disabled. To enable macros edit the file escheme.scm and 
set enable-macros to true:

   (define enable-macros #t)

Invoke escheme and a macro prepass is enabled for all subsequently entered 
symbolic expressions.
