Building and Running

Building

In the root directory type 'make' to build the executable:

   $make [-f makefile]


Running

To run the interpreter in the build directory invoke escheme. The banner is printed and the
linenoise prompt is displayed:

   $ ./escheme
   escheme v1.0 (interpreter)

   escheme>

Loadable and executable files can be added to the command line:

   $ ./escheme tests/run_tests1.scm tests/run_tests2.scm
   

To exit escheme, type ^D, ^C or exit function at the prompt:

   escheme> (exit)


Installation and Removal

The scheme interpeter and its supporting files can be installed on Unix/Linux systems.

   $ sudo make install

The interpreter can now be invoked anywhere, not just off of the build directory, using the
pathless executable name "escheme". The executable is installed in /usr/local/bin which
should be included in the path definition, if not already.

Lastly the interpreter can be uninstalled.

   $ sudo make uninstall
