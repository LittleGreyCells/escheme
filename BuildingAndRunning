Building and Running

Building

In the root directory type 'make' to build the executable:

   $make [-f makefile]


Running

To run the interpreter, invoke escheme. The banner is printed and the linenoise prompt is
displayed:

   $ ./escheme
   escheme (interpreter)

   ece>

Loadable and executable files can be added to the command line:

   $ ./escheme tests/run_tests1.scm tests/run_tests2.scm
   

To exit escheme, type ^D, ^C or exit function at the prompt:

   ece> (exit)


Installation and Removal

The scheme interpeter and its supporting files can be installed on Unix/Linux systems.

   $ sudo make install

The interpreter can now be invoked anywhere, not just off of the build directory, using the
pathless executable name "escheme". The executable is installed in /usr/local/bin which
should be included in the path definition, if not already.

One can still invoke the build directory interpreter using "./escheme". Although this might
be a tad confusing.

Lastly the interpreter can be uninstalled.

   $ sudeo make uninstall
