Building and Running

Building

In the root directory type 'make' to build the executable:

   $make [-f makefile]


Running

To run the interpreter, invoke escheme with no arguments. The banner 
is printed and the linenoise prompt is displayed:

   $ ./escheme
   escheme v1.0

   ece>

To exit escheme, type ^D, ^C or exit function at the prompt:

   ece> (exit)
   $

To prevent the macro subsystem load (and overhead), use the --nomacros option:

   $ ./escheme --nomacros
   escheme v1.0 (no macros)

   ece>

This will marginally increase evaluator speed at the cost of macros and 
some special forms (let*, case, do).
