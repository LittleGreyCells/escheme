This "compiler" endeavors to opitizime symbolic expressions with more efficient 
subsitutions.

1. symbol references -- dynamic lookups are replaced with "addresses" 
      local references:  LREF -- [framedepth, index]
      glboal references: GREF -- symbol

2. lambda creation -- replace costly reinterpretation of lambda form with
      a pre-analyzed substitution -- CLAMBDA

3. local defines -- nested defines are replaced with let/set!.

Subsequent timing studies have shown that these substitions, although
theoretically more time efficient, are practically negligible.
